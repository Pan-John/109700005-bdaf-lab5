# 109700005-bdaf-lab5

Here's my token contract address [PeTeCoin](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xd05dE044d4B447607B146d4AC0FA052913465176#writeContract), I accidentally add another `transferOwnership` function cuz i didn't realize that openzeppelin had one. This lab is very interesting although it's quite "expensive" lol, thanks again for the geth Martinet.
